## Asignment
This project is for the OBA (Amsterdam Public Library). They are looking for a way to make resources easy to find for visitors to the library. 
I have chosen for the subject feeding and dietry.
The user story is as follows:
'Als sportieve twintiger wil ik mij verdiepen in het effect van gezonde voeding op mijn conditie, om te leren hoe ik mijn sport beter kan beoefenen.'

## Features 
To make a simple and user friendly web page I have chosen 3 subjects were they can find the right information. The 3 subjects:
1. Vegan products
2. Protein
3. Intermittent fasting
